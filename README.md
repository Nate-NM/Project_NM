## Use Case
1. RocketDNA: Drone security company. Drones reported back to a central "call center" far away from site. Needed a way to guide on site resources to intrusion. Corrdination between a "mobile unit" which was a vehicle and<br>
several on site personnel. Ideal condition would be drone footage to in site resources along with GPS  and live map along with markers set by either party to assist in intrusion intercept
2. Plexus ISR: Backup for cell connected ATAK network, body worn radios. Was very interested in Meshtastic
3. Off-Roading: Some interest expressed for a system that would allow connectivity voice/location between mildy widely separated offroading groups
4. Disaster Recovery: Some interest from a group up in the Carolinas that were heavily impacted by the hurricanes this season. Cell/data networks were down for extended periods of time, VHF voice was about all that still worked, but tough to coordinate with just that. The city/county level government allegedly has a desire for a better off-grid networking solution
