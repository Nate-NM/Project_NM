Install/remove
1. install wpad mesh
2. remove wpad basic
3. install mesh11sd
4. install kmod-mt76x0u (for awus036achm)

goto network>interfaces. should have a bridge, change that IP to the mesh IP you want 192.168.200.xxx

after installation steps, wireless should now have "Sabrent NTWLAC 802.11ac/b/g/n" device. This is the awus036achm
will give 30 dbm on 2.4 ghz, but give it a shot at 5 gGHz
Hit "add"  
tx power= driver default
mode=AC
channel=36
width=20 MHz
802.11s
mesh_id= natak_mesh
network= lan
security= open for now, will set up SAE later



the hotspot need to be "legacy" mode at 2.4 ghz and set to a static channel
add that to same lan bridge as the mesh
