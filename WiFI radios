looks like its 30dbm at 2.4GHz, 23 DBM at 5 GHz  https://apps.fcc.gov/eas/GetApplicationAttachment.html?id=3619064
but having driver issues, cannot seem to get this over 14 dbm per power meter. there are several river options, morrownr, aircrack and rtw88 are the main ones it 
seems

had some issues using this with normal linux, but am seeing 30dbm on 2.4 ghz using openwrt. but in the 5 ghz range, it will not form a
mesh at some of the higher channels. and while it will mesh at some of the lower 5ghz channels, my power meter doesnt
work in that range, so not sure what the 5ghz power is
